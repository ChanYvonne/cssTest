	<p> I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! You don't know how to do any of those. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

	  And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
